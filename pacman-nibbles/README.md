# Pacman-Nibbles

A fun game that combines elements of classic Pacman and Snake (Nibbles) games.

## Game Concept

In Pacman-Nibbles, you control a snake that moves around a maze. The goal is to eat dots to grow longer while avoiding walls and ghosts. Power pellets allow you to temporarily eat the ghosts for bonus points.

## Game Features

- Snake movement mechanics (from Nibbles/Snake)
- Dot collection and maze navigation (from Pacman)
- Ghosts that chase the player (from Pacman)
- Power pellets that let you eat ghosts (from Pacman)
- Snake growth when eating dots (from Nibbles)

## Controls

- Arrow keys to change direction
- R to restart after game over

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Run the game: `python pacman_nibbles.py`

## Game Rules

- Move your snake around the maze to collect dots
- Each dot increases your score and makes your snake longer
- Avoid running into walls or your own tail
- Ghosts will chase you - avoid them!
- Collect power pellets to temporarily gain the ability to eat ghosts
- The game ends when you hit a wall, your own tail, or a ghost (when not powered up)

Have fun playing!
